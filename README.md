# stranded
Demo game created with Unity engine for my 2022 final year's project on video games &amp; animation.
Along with teammate Eloy Caro, we worked on the concept art, 3D models, animations and game mechanics for 9 months.
I was responsible for most of the programming.
You can find the game page and playable file on itch.io:
